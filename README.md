### Shelf Log Project

##

## Framework - React

I used react frontend framework because I am very comfortable using it.

## State management

I used Tanstack Query to handle my interaction with the backend.

I used axios to make http requests to the backend server.

I also used the context api to avoid prop drilling when handling showing the add book form.

## Styling

I used styled-components to style my react components

## Deployment

I deployed my project on netlify for simplicity purposes

## Other notes

I tried to make my components reusable as much as possible
